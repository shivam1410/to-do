# ToDo

 basic ToDo app generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.\
 This project is generated as an assignment by an organisation,\
 this app gives user the ability to create a to-do schedule list along with the date for each task.\
 user can edit the task as well as the date.  User can tick if the task is completed , then the task will automatically move to bottom of the list.\
 every task  is provided with an option to delete it.
 
 # Frameworks/libraries used
 
  I have used basic Angular material for provideing styling and animation offered by google.\
  I have used firebase for the database, that will store the list of tasks.
